EVM -Etherium virtual machine can access and store information in six places 
1) Stack
2)Memory
3)Storage
4)call data
5) code
6)logs


EVM compatible blockchains are Etherium, polygon,Arbitrium,Optimism
Smart contract are set of instructions executed in decentralized way 
Blockchain can't read data from real word this is called oracle problem
Oracle provides data to dentralized network  or do external computation



Chainlink is decentralized oracle network
Smart contract trust minimized agreement
speed efficieny transipiracy
it is unbreakable promise

Smart contract is set of instructions deployed on decentralized blockchains
DeFi-Decentralized finance
DAO-Decentrailized Automation organization
NFT-Non fungible token
More than i account in metamask can have same recovery phrase but each account have seperate public key and private key



Gas price is cost per unit gass specified for transaction
in Ether or Gwei
Higher the gas price,higher chance of getting inlcuded in the block



Gas is unit of computational measurement more complex your transaction more gas you have to pay
Hash is unique fixed length string to identify data
Nounce is number only used once ,problem of miner is find nounce for block ,data and Hash
Gensis block is first block in block Chain



Access modifiers in solidity are
1)public -visible externally and internally
2)private-only visible in current contract
3)external-only visible externally
4)internal-only visible internally
